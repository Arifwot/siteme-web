        <li>
          Identification of the copyrighted work claimed to have been infringed,
          or, if multiple copyrighted works are covered by a single
          notification, a representative list of such works.
        </li>
        <li>
          Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to
          be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or
          access to which is to be disabled, and information reasonably
          sufficient to permit WotPan to locate the material (e.g., URL or
          specific in-app location).
        </li>
        <li>
          Information reasonably sufficient to permit WotPan to contact the
          complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if
          available, an electronic mail address.
        </li>
        <li>
          A statement that the complaining party has a good faith belief that
          use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by
          the copyright owner, its agent, or the law.
        </li>
        <li>
          A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and
          under penalty of perjury, that the complaining party is authorized to
          act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly
          infringed.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Upon receipt of a valid Takedown Notice, WotPan will take appropriate
        action, which may include removing or disabling access to the allegedly
        infringing material.

      <h2>3. Counter-Notice Procedures</h2>
      <p>

        by mistake or misidentification, you may submit a Counter-Notice to our
        Designated Agent (listed in Section 1).

      <ol>
        <li>Your physical or electronic signature.</li>
        <li>
          Identification of the material that has been removed or to which
          access has been disabled and the location at which the material
          appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled.
        </li>
        <li>
          A statement under penalty of perjury that you have a good faith belief
          that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or
          misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that you
          consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the
          judicial district in which your address is located, or if your address
          is outside of India, for any judicial district in which WotPan may be
          found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who
          provided the original Takedown Notice.
        </li>
      </ol>
