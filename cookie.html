      <p>
        This Cookie Policy explains how WotPan (“we”, “our”, “us”) uses cookies
        and similar technologies when you visit our website (wotpan.com) or use
        our mobile and desktop applications (the “Service”).
      </p>

      <h2>1. What are Cookies?</h2>
      <p>
        Cookies are small text files placed on your computer or mobile device
        when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work, or
        work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information. When
        referring to "cookies" in this policy, we include other technologies
        like pixel tags, web beacons, and device identifiers.
      </p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Cookies</h2>
      <p>
        We use cookies and similar technologies for several purposes, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          **Authentication:** To identify you and keep you logged in to the
          Service.
        </li>
        <li>
          **Security:** To support or enable security features and to help
          detect malicious activity.
        </li>
        <li>
          **Functionality:** To remember your preferences and settings (like
          language or region).
        </li>
        <li>
          **Performance and Analytics:** To help us understand how the Service
          is being used, measure the effectiveness of our features, and monitor
          overall performance.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Types of Cookies We Use</h2>
      <p>
        We use both session and persistent cookies, and first-party and
        third-party cookies:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Essential Cookies:</strong> These are strictly necessary for
          the operation of our Service, enabling core functions like logging in,
          making purchases, and securing your account. The Service cannot
          function properly without these cookies.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Analytics/Performance Cookies:</strong> These cookies collect
          information about how you use our Service, such as which pages you
          visit and if you experience any errors. This data is aggregated and
          anonymous, and is used solely to improve how the Service works.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Third-Party Cookies:</strong> Our Service integrates features
          from third-party service providers (e.g., for analytics, crash
          reporting, or social login functionality). These third parties may set
          their own cookies to perform their services. We do not control these
          cookies, and their use is governed by the respective third parties'
          privacy policies.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Your Choices and Control</h2>
      <p>You have the ability to control and manage cookies:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Browser Settings:</strong> Most web browsers allow you to
          manage your cookie preferences. You can set your browser to refuse all
          cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Note that blocking
          or disabling certain cookies may prevent the Service from functioning
          correctly.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Device Settings:</strong> For mobile applications, your device
          may offer settings that enable you to control advertising tracking
          identifiers (e.g., 'Limit Ad Tracking' on iOS or 'Opt-out of Ads
          Personalization' on Android).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Third-Party Opt-Outs:</strong> You may be able to opt out of
          certain third-party services directly through their websites.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Changes to this Policy</h2>

        We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time to reflect changes in
        our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We
        will post the updated policy on our website and update the "Last
        Updated" date above.
