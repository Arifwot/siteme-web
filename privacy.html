      </ul>

      <h2>6. Retention</h2>
      <p>
        We retain personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes
        described (account maintenance, legal obligations, fraud prevention,
        backups). When data is no longer required, we will delete or anonymize

      </p>

      <h2>8. Grievance & contact (Data requests, complaints)</h2>
      <p>
        If you have a privacy question, complaint or want to exercise your
        rights:
      </p>
      <div class="contact-info">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Email:</strong>
            <a href="mailto:Support@wotpan.com">Support@wotpan.com</a>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Phone:</strong> +91-7017127130</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Address:</strong> House 95, Longi Kala, Thakurdwara,
            Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh 244601, India

      </div>
      <p>
        We provide a readily available grievance redressal channel and will
        respond to complaints and data requests in line with applicable law. If
        you remain unsatisfied you may have the right to lodge a complaint with
        the relevant regulator.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Security & End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)</h2>
      <p>
        WotPan uses technical and organizational measures (industry-standard
        encryption, secure servers) to protect data. For private chats, we
        provide **end-to-end encryption** which means message content is
        cryptographically accessible only to the communicating users (not
        WotPan). However, certain metadata (timestamps, sender/recipient
        identifiers, message size) may be processed by us to route and deliver
        messages, prevent abuse, and provide features. While we use strong
        safeguards, no system is perfectly secure.
      </p>

      <h2>10. Cookies, analytics & third-party SDKs</h2>
      <p>
        We use cookies and similar technologies to operate the site and gather
        analytics. Third-party analytics/providers may collect information as
        described in their privacy policies. You may control some cookies via
        your browser/device settings. Where we use third-party providers
        (analytics, crash reporting, performance tools), their privacy policies
        will apply to their processing.
      </p>

      <h2>11. Beta, development, early access</h2>
      <p>
        WotPan’s apps are under development. If you enroll in pre-release or
        beta programs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Data created during beta may be used to diagnose problems, improve
          features, and tune performance.
        </li>
        <li>We may provide specific terms for beta testers.</li>
        <li>
          Beta data may be deleted on request, but we may retain anonymized or
          aggregated analytics.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you do not want your data used for testing or analytics during beta,
        please contact
        <a href="mailto:Support@wotpan.com">Support@wotpan.com</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>12. International transfers</h2>
      <p>
        WotPan operates globally. Personal data may be processed or stored
        outside your country. We will ensure such transfers comply with
        applicable law and use appropriate safeguards.
      </p>

      <h2>13. Children</h2>
      <p>
        WotPan is for adults (18+). We do not knowingly collect personal data
        from children under 18. If we learn of such collection, we will delete
        the data promptly.
      </p>

      <h2>14. Data breach notification</h2>
      <p>
        If we become aware of a personal data breach, we will follow applicable
        law and regulatory guidance. Where required by law, we will notify the
        relevant Data Protection Board / regulator and affected users without
        undue delay and in accordance with regulatory requirements (draft rules
        foresee detailed reporting and an initial report followed by a fuller
        report within 72 hours).
      </p>

      <h2>15. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Policy. If we make **material changes**, we will post
        an updated version on our site and, where appropriate, notify you in-app
        or by email.
      </p>

      <h2>16. Governing law</h2>
